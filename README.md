# The_end

usage: 
  cd The_end/ ; ./end.sh

This script modifies bash by adding aliases such as redirecting some commands, making some folders invisible. After adding aliases, the_end folder will self-destruct.

NB: This script is intended to harm. Do not run it on your computer under any circumstances.

The fix folder containing a fix script is available on my github account in order to restore the damage caused by the_end.
The_end is in perpetual improvement so your ideas are welcome.
